# challengeApp
I have built this app for hackerearth challenge. It has three four screens, which you can see in below figures. 

## Features
1. In this app I have used square retofit lib to make the API calling fast to fast. 
2. Once data loaded on screen. It has automated store in cache for one week. So it increase the ability of work.
3. I have added list scroll animation, which make it very cool.
